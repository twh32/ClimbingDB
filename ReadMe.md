## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-link>
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository and install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   cd <repository-name>
   pip install matplotlib pandas numpy seaborn
   ```

3. Run the python script to process the data:
   ```bash
   python dt_pandas.py
   ```

## Analysis

We merged the climbing data with demographic data to derive insights and conclusions. The merged data can be found in `merged_demographics.csv`. The visualizations provide a clear representation of these findings.
# Bouldering Dataset Analysis

This repository contains data and visualizations related to a bouldering dataset. Our primary aim was to merge different demographic datasets with climbing data to draw meaningful conclusions.
